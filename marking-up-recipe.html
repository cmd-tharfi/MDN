<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted 
from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, 
grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><p>
<ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
</ul>
  

<p><strong>Instructions</strong><p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
  <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
  <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
  <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
</ol>

<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, 
    lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

  <p><strong>Storage</strong></p>

  <ul>
  <li>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week 
      after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</li>
  <li>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</li>
  </ul>
